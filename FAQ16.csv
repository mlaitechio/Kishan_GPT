Please clarify for 30 year tenure; 30 years tenure cannot be given in under-construction properties where customer will serve PEMI; Or Cases with 30 years tenure shall be booked under EMIUC only(Customer pays EMI during the under-construction period),Cases with 30 years tenure shall be booked under EMI under construction only.,
What is the reason that customer rate of interest is high as compared to new customer’s rate and that to avail prevailing rate he needs to opt for conversion,If the customer has availed loan under floating rate of interest then the applicable rate that is offered to customer is I-MCLR-1Y/I-Base/FRR/PLR plus margin. The I-MCLR-1Y/I-Base/FRR/PLR is linked to market condition and the margin that is offered to customer remains fixed throughout the tenure of the loan. Hence whenever there is change in I-MCLR-1Y/IBase/FRR/PLR rate the ROI gets effected. Due to this the existing customer rate is higher from the prevailing rate. For e.g. at the time of availing loan ROI was 8% (IBase) + 2% margin (fixed) so effective ROI was 10%. Now IBase has changed from 8% to 9.75%. As the margin was fixed the effective ROI has now become to 9.75% + 2% = 11.75%. Hence if customer wants to avail prevailing rate customer has to opt for conversion to change the contracted terms,
